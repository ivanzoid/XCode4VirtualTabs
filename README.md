### Description

This plugin changes the behaviour of XCode's text editor so if you are really using spaces in indentation Settings, it changes cursor movement in a way so it appears that you are using tabs.
At this time behaviour of ← and → keys is changed (more to follow).

### Installation

Download and compile the project, the plugin will be installed during build process to `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/`
